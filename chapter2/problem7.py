#Python has built-in functions min and max to compute minimum and maximum of a given list. Provide an implementation for these functions. What happens when you call your min and max functions with a list of strings?
print max(1, 2, 3, 4)
print min(1, 2, 3, 4)
x = [1, 2, 3, 4]
print max(x)
print min(x)
print max("sudheesh","ajith")
print min("sudheesh","ajith")
y = ["sudheesh", "ajith"]
print max(y)
print min(y)
